# Project Setup Instructions

Thank you for downloading this project! To run it locally, please follow these steps:

 ### Step 1: Download and Extract

1. Download the ZIP file**: First, download the provided ZIP file of the project.
2. Extract the ZIP file**: Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file into a folder of your choice.

  Step 2: Create a Firebase Project

1. Create a Firebase Project: 
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and set up Firebase services like Firestore (for the database), Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage (for image storage).
   
  Step 3: Install Firebase in Your Project

1. Install Firebase:
   - Inside the extracted project folder, run the following command to install Firebase:
     ```bash
     npm install firebase
     ```

  Step 4: Initialize Firebase

1. Initialize Firebase:
   - After setting up Firebase, you will receive your Firebase configuration details (API keys, etc.).
   - Use this configuration to initialize Firebase in the project.
   - Replace the contents of the `fireBaseConfique.js` file (located in the project) with the Firebase initialization code:
     ```js
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
     ```
   - Save this file.

  Step 5: Install Node Modules

1. Install Node Modules:
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies (including Firebase and other libraries):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

  Step 6: Run the Project

1. Run the Project:
   - After setting up Firebase and installing the dependencies, you can run the project by using:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will launch the application locally on your machine.

Notes:

- Make sure you have **Node.js** installed before running the commands.
- Replace the Firebase configuration correctly to ensure all services (Firestore, Authentication, and Storage) work properly.

That's it! Follow the steps carefully, and your project should run successfully. Happy coding!
